Personal testbench where I try out things.

- Python app, not meant to be used as a library.
- Web application using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- For testing [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) is used.
- Release Management with
  [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Focused on
  simple manual release process with the option add custom info to a release and
  the changelog before performing a release. Balance between full automation
  with something like semantic-release and manual release creation via the
  GitHub UI.
- Pre-commit stuff. Code coverage with CodeCov. Poetry.
- ...
